Lesson 8 Django Project Assignment in Python Internet course
The blogging app was modified to use class-based views rather than functions

To run the project, go into the mysite folder and enter `python manage.py runserver`.  Load http://localhost:8000/admin/ in the browser and the page will present you with a login screen, where you can enter the superuser name and password that you created earlier in the lesson.

In addition to the Authentication and Authorization section where you can add or delete groups or users, there is a blogging app and polling app where you can create blogs and polls.
